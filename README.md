Guess A Number Game App 

This app was created using Android Studio and Java Programming language. I created this during a 7 day challenge to keep myself accountable. I learned a lot about UI design as well as making an app functional. 

# About Application

The application is a game that users can play. They must guess a number between 1-100 and if the user doesn't get the right answer they must play again. The game will also show the number of tries that the user has taken.
